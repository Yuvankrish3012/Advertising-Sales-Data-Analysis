# Advertising-Sales-Data-Analysis
This repository presents an analysis of advertising expenditures across different platforms and their impact on sales, including a sales prediction model.

Project Overview:

Objective: Understand the relationship between advertising spend on TV, Radio, and Newspaper and its effect on sales, and build a predictive model for sales forecasting.

Key Findings:
TV and Radio advertising show a strong positive correlation with sales.
Newspaper advertising appears to have a weaker or less consistent impact on sales.

Model Details:
Model Used: Linear Regression
RÂ² Score: 0.906 (indicating that approximately 90.6% of sales variance is explained by advertising expenditures, suggesting a strong model).
RMSE: 1.704 (the model's predictions deviate from actual sales by about 1.7 units on average, indicating good accuracy).

Recommendations:
Continue strategic investment in TV and Radio advertising due to their high effectiveness.
Re-evaluate Newspaper advertising strategies or reallocate budget to more impactful channels.
Utilize the predictive model for sales forecasting and optimized resource allocation.
